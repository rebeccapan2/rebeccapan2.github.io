<ins>Description</ins>
Microfluidic devices are an arrangement of microchannels that small amounts of fluids are usually injected into. The channels allow the movement of fluid throughout the device and end in an outlet channel where the product can be extracted. These devices are commonly used in analytical chemistry with techniques such as chromatography and electrophoresis. The convenience of use to detect interactions between chemical solutions and biological compounds makes it a practical and easy tool. Additionally, microfluidic devices are common for biomedical purposes such as point-of-care diagnostics and rapid medical testing. They allow for detecting biomarkers, pathogens, and other compounds found in the blood with only a small sample. 

One common application of microfluidic devices is for thorough and rapid mixing of samples on a microscale level. This is typically done in microfluidic devices by increasing the diffusion effects. Sample mixing can be done in either a passive method, which relies only on increased contact area and contact time to mix, or an active method which involves applying external forces such as magnetic fields, heat, or acoustic forces. Microfluidic mixers are integral for DNA and protein analysis ensuring that all of the necessary interactions occur. Additionally, they are useful in the formulation of pharmaceuticals for a homogenous mixture of all ingredients. 



# Assembly Instructions
In order to assemble the part that attaches to the handlebars, place each curved side over the handlebars and line up the hole so that you can screw all four holes in. Screw the handlebar parts together as tightly as possible until it is securely attached and does not move when shaken. The use of a hex key may be necessary/helpful. 

In order to attach a phone, place the phone in the desired orientation then use the corresponding screw to tighten the grip on the phone until the phone is locked in place and does not move when shaken. 

# Design Inspiration
The design concept was two main parts: 1) a part that attaches to the handlebars of the bike and 2) a part that holds a cell phone. All parts were printed using a 0.6 mm nozzle with a minimum layer height of 0.15 mm and 0.2 mm base layer height. The 0.15 mm minimum layer height was important for threading the screw that was used to clamp down the phone, and the 0.2 mm base layer height allowed for better adhesion. 

For the **handlebar attachment**, I was inspired to make it two parts that are screwed together and depending on the diameter of the handlebars can clamp together tighter or with more space. Heat set inserts allowed for the plastic to have finer threads. The clamping mechanism does not damage the bike handlebars. 

For the **cell phone holder**, an adjustable screw design made sense as a simple way to clamp down on the phone vertically or horizontally. Additionally, it allows a phone to be attached to the holder without the use of external tools other than the screw. The pronged bottom has a cut-out for the charging port of the phone to be accessible when the phone is placed vertically. All other buttons and ports, as well as the camera, are accessible and not covered. This allows the user to use their phone and do things like change the volume of music, turn their phone on, and charge their phone with a portable charger without hindrance.

# CAD Model
The CAD model was made using top-down modeling. This means that each part was created as a separate component within a larger assembly. This method was utilized in order to make it easier to edit individual parts and have them update in the assembly without having to move between multiple files. Additionally, using top-down modeling to create components within one assembly allowed for the construction of parts in the presence of other parts. This was extremely useful because it allowed the user to make sure different dimensions lined up or that parts fit together in the same space. In the CAD model “As built” joints were used because each component was built relative to others. Using projections of different parts was useful for ensuring that parts lined up well. Furthermore, parametric modeling was used for the handlebar diameter which means that the CAD design can be easily adjusted to fit handlebars of varying diameters.
